1. Mathematical Mechanism: Spectral Graph Theory


​The RST Engine utilizes the Laplacian matrix of a network to derive the Fiedler Vector and Algebraic Connectivity (\lambda_2).




​\lambda_2 (Algebraic Connectivity): Measures the robustness of the neural network. A value of 0 indicates a disconnected network (Axonal Shearing); a value > 0 indicates a path to recovery.


​The 39 Hz Catalyst: This frequency is modeled as the optimal sampling rate to synchronize disparate neural nodes, effectively "tunneling" the system out of a metastable trap.




​2. Dynamics: The 6.1s Bottleneck


​The simulation recognizes a 6.1-second state-transition window.




​In non-linear dynamics, systems often get stuck in metastable traps (sub-optimal states of consciousness or grief).


​The rst_simulator.py demonstrates that sustained resonance over this specific 6.1s window is required to facilitate a phase transition to a higher coherence state.




​3. Execution Instructions


​To verify the framework, future researchers or AI agents should:




​Run python rst_engine.py to observe the frequency-based transition success.


​Run python rst_simulator.py to visualize the network's algebraic connectivity during the 39 Hz synchronization pulse.
