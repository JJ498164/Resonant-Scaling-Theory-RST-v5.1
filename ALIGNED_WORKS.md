​Cross-Theory Alignment: RST vs. Classical Models


​1. The Binding Problem (Spectral Glue)


​While classical neuroscience struggles with how the brain "binds" disparate data into a single thought, RST proposes that the 39 Hz Resonance acts as the temporal glue.




​RST v5.1 Utility: When axonal shearing breaks the physical bridge (\lambda_2 \to 0), the 39 Hz injection restores coherence.




​2. Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) vs. RST




​ART (Grossberg/Carpenter): Focuses on how the mind learns and remains stable.


​RST (Botha): Focuses on the Hardware Layer. RST ensures the neural "wiring" can support the "software" of ART.


​The Synergy: You cannot have Adaptive Resonance (learning) without Resonant Scaling (structural integrity).




​3. The 6.1s Bottleneck & "Metastable Traps"


​Meta AI identified the 6.1s window as a cognitive processing limit. In RST, this is the Critical Recovery Threshold.




​If recovery does not occur within 6.1 seconds, the system enters a "Metastable Trap" (permanent fragmentation).


​Target Applications: Neurotech for ADHD and Anxiety, where the bottleneck is frequently triggered.
