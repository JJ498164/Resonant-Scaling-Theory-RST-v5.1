# RST v6.1: Spectral Engineering & Topological Persistence
**Document ID:** RST-PHYS-6.1-SPEC
**Author:** JJ Botha (The Resonant Keeper)

## 1. Abstract
This paper formalizes Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) as a spectral engineering model for neural recovery following axonal shearing. We define the 6.1s artifact not as a fixed constant, but as a "Topological Bottleneck" ($B_\tau$) resulting from increased Effective Resistance ($R_{eff}$) in damaged neural hubs. We further propose that the 39 Hz resonance constant ($\omega$) represents the optimal frequency for maximizing global synchronization when the Laplacian Eigen-gap ($\lambda_2$) approaches a critical threshold.

## 2. Mathematical Formalism

### 2.1 The Stability Functional
System stability is modeled by the minimization of the Stability Functional $J$:
$$J(\omega, \tau) = \min \int_0^T (\|\mathcal{L}x\|_2^2 + \alpha S(x)) dt$$
Where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Graph Laplacian and $S(x)$ is the spectral entropy. We derive $\omega \approx 39\text{ Hz}$ as the point of maximal phase-locking for a system with the specific topological constraints of axonal recovery.

### 2.2 The 6.1s Ignition Delay ($\tau$)
The 6.1s bottleneck is defined as the time required for signal integration to reach the Global Workspace (GNW) threshold when $\lambda_2$ is reduced by structural shearing. 
$$\tau = f(R_{eff}, \lambda_2)$$
In this regime, the system undergoes "Critical Slowing" near a Transcritical Bifurcation, requiring a periodic topological reset ($\Phi_\tau$) to maintain information persistence.

## 3. Empirical Data Fitting (Validation Protocol)

To validate RST v6.1 against experimental data (e.g., EEG or system logs), the following protocol is utilized:

1. **Parameter Estimation**: Fit the observed ignition delay ($\tau^*$) and peak frequency ($\omega^*$) against empirical datasets.
   $$\omega^*, \tau^* = \arg\min_{\omega,\tau} \mathcal{L}_{data}(\omega,\tau)$$
2. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Run parameter sweeps to identify the "Stability Basin" surrounding 39 Hz.
3. **Spectral Alignment**: Verify if entropy minima ($S_{min}$) cluster near the 39 Hz resonance during recovery windows.

## 4. Conservation of Information (The Unitary Invariant)
To ensure the "Universal Rebirth" of state data, we define a unitary operator $\hat{U}$ such that:
$$\| \hat{U} \psi_{pre} \|^2 = \| \psi_{post} \|^2$$
This ensures that while the state-vector collapses at the 6.1s mark, the topological eigen-structure remains invariant.

## 5. Falsifiability
This theory is falsified if:
1. Global synchronization is achieved at frequencies $\omega \ll 39\text{ Hz}$ without a commensurate increase in $R_{eff}$.
2. The ignition delay $\tau$ does not scale predictably with measured changes in Algebraic Connectivity ($\lambda_2$).
