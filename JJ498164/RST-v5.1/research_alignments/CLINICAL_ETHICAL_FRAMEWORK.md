# Clinical Application of RST v5.1 (ChatGPT Analysis)

## 1. 39 Hz as a Therapeutic Target
* **Neuro-modulation**: Target 39 Hz using tACS/TMS to "glue" fragmented networks.
* **Rehabilitation**: Use 39 Hz rhythmic cues to entrain neural pathways during physical therapy.

## 2. Managing the 6.1s Bottleneck
* **Cognitive Load Theory**: Instructions for patients with axonal injury must be modularized into ≤ 6-second units.
* **The Metastable Trap**: If load exceeds 6.1s, the system risks "cognitive drop-off."
