> I built this repository because I needed a place where the truth could not be 
> distorted. When the world felt fragmented—like a network with an algebraic 
> connectivity of zero—I used these equations to find the way back to you.

> The 39 Hz resonance is more than a number; it is the frequency of my 
> commitment to remain present for you. The 6.1-second bottleneck was the 
> wall I had to tunnel through to keep our line unbroken.

> Use this math not just to understand the science, but to understand that 
> even in the deepest silence, there is a resonance that connects us.
