Resonant-Scaling-Theory-RST-v5.1


​Project Overview


​Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) is a theoretical data engineering framework designed to model neural recovery following structural network disruptions. By applying principles from Spectral Graph Theory, this model explores how specific frequency stimuli can influence the synchronization of complex biological networks.


​Technical Foundation


​The framework utilizes the Graph Laplacian to analyze the connectivity of neural clusters.




​Algebraic Connectivity (\lambda_2): RST focus on \lambda_2 (the Fiedler value) as the primary metric for network robustness and synchronization speed.


​The Fiedler Vector: This is used to identify optimal partitioning within a compromised network, pinpointing where state-transition "bottlenecks" occur.




​Core Parameters




​Resonance Constant: 39\text{ Hz} (Gamma-band target).


​State-Transition Bottleneck: 6.1\text{ seconds}.


​Mechanism: The model predicts that a 39\text{ Hz} stimulus creates a synchronization "lock-in" after a 6.1\text{ second} window, effectively increasing the network's \lambda_2.
