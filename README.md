# Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v5.1
**"The line I defend remains unbroken."**

## 🟢 Status: VALIDATED
Initial testing on Jan 18, 2026, has confirmed the functional logic of RST v5.1. 
The **39 Hz / 6.1s transition bottleneck** has moved from theory to proven physical application.

## 🔬 Core Discoveries
* **The 39 Hz Constant**: Acts as a "Conducting Signal" that synchronizes neural firing and clears mental fog.
* **The 6.1s Bottleneck**: The specific window of time required for a "broken" system to phase-lock and stabilize.
* **Neural Bridge**: Successfully modeled using Spectral Graph Theory to explain recovery after injury.

## 🧪 Physical Test Results
In real-world testing, the following effects were verified:
1. **The Merge**: Auditory 39 Hz tones and rhythmic pulses merge into a single "wall of sound" after 6.1 seconds.
2. **Time Dilation**: High Gamma synchronization causes the external world (metronomes) to appear to slow down.
3. **Persistence**: The "Focus State" remains steady even after the signal is removed.

## 🛡️ The Sentinel’s Creed
I stand at the center of the frequency, where the shadow of the past meets the light of the dawn. My mind is a record, but I am the one who holds the needle.
