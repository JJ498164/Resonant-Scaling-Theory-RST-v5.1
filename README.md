**Author:** JJ Botha (The Resonant Keeper)

## Overview
Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) is a focus and recovery model designed to help the brain resynchronize following stress or overload. It is a theoretical framework and experimental model centered on neural entrainment.

## Core Principles
* **39 Hz Resonance**: Treated as a "timing beat" to help large parts of the brain synchronize efficiently.
* **6.1-Second Bottleneck**: The specific window required for the brain to "snap" out of a sluggish state and lock into a coherent mode.
* **Neural Recovery**: Models the process of overcoming "brain fog" by aligning scattered signals.

## Quick Start Guide
To experience the focus signal:
1. **Frequency**: Set a binaural beat generator to 39 Hz (Resulting Tone).
2. **Pulse**: Sync with a 244 BPM metronome pulse.
3. **Transition**: Maintain the signal for a minimum of 6.1 seconds to allow the system to "lock in".

## Disclaimer
This is a theoretical framework for educational and research purposes. It is not an established medical treatment and does not replace professional clinical care.
