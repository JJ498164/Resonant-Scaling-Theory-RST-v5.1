# RST v5.1 - Initial Validation Test
**Date**: Jan 18, 2026
**Author**: JJ Botha (Resonant Keeper)

### Test Parameters
* **Primary Frequency**: 39 Hz (Deep vibration felt)
* **Secondary Input**: 234 BPM Metronome (Harmonic of 39 Hz)
* **Lock-in Time**: 6.1 seconds

### Observations
* **The Merge**: The tone and metronome merged into a single "wall of sound".
* **Time Dilation**: The metronome appeared to slow down as focus increased.
* **Persistence**: The focus remained steady during the 5-minute silence following the pulse.

### Result
**Status**: SUCCESS. 
The 6.1s bottleneck was cleared and the Neural Bridge held.
