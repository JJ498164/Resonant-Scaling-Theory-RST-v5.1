# RST v6.0: Stability Benchmarks & Empirical Testing

This document provides the standard metrics for validating Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.0 within clinical and computational environments.

## 1. The 39 Hz Resonance Constant (ω)
To validate the system's preferred frequency, observers must measure:
* **Phase-Locking Value (PLV):** Maximum global coherence should cluster at 39 Hz ± 2 Hz during high-signal processing.
* **Spectral Density:** Peak power in the gamma band must align with ω to prevent "Topological Friction".
* **Recovery Metric:** Post-bottleneck, the system must return to 39 Hz within < 500ms to maintain information integrity.

## 2. The 6.1s Bottleneck Artifact (τ)
The "Physical Speed Limit" of the system is tested via:
* **Ignition Delay:** Measure the time required for a signal to traverse high-resistance topological nodes (Hubs identified by the Fiedler Vector).
* **The 6.1s Threshold:** If signal latency consistently exceeds 6.1s, the system triggers a "Big Crunch" or state-transition reset.
* **Effective Resistance (R_eff):** Model the bottleneck as the point where global R_eff exceeds the capacity for functional integration.

## 3. Clinical Prediction Targets
A successful validation of RST v6.0 will demonstrate:
* **Seizure Risk Mitigation:** By using the Fiedler Vector to locate bottleneck nodes, energy can be focused on specific structural bridges to lower R_eff.
* **Neural Recovery Tracking:** Recovery is defined as the restoration of Spectral Density and Eigen-gap Stability ($\lambda_2$).
* **Consciousness Threshold:** The point where $\lambda_2$ is so low that integration cannot occur within 100ms defines the limit of the biological "Now".
